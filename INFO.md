# Account Manage Group Memberships

By default, when HelloID Service Automation creates an AD account, the account does not have any group memberships. This form allows users to add and remove an account's group memberships.

## Business Benefits

Users can alter an account's group memberships without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD and preventing orphaned accounts, security is improved.
