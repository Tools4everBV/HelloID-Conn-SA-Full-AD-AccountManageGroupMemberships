# Account Manage Group Memberships

By default, when HelloID Service Automation creates an AD account, the account does not have any group memberships. This form adds and removes an account's group memberships.

## Business Benefits

This form can alter an account's group memberships without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved.
